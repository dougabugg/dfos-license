# Doug's Free and Open Source License
NOTE: the license of this git repository is in `./LICENSE`, and the text of the dfos-license is in `dfos-license.md`. You can find Doug's email in the git history of this repository.

# TODO
Actually, I should probably un-escape the angle brackets, and make a file called `DFOS-LICENSE`, since I don't want it to be markdown anyways.

Also, the text should be generic for whatever the file the license resides in is named.
